# Models - Source Code
The file links below will display source code, outputs, and reports for each of the Public School example models in any web browser.  You may also download the files and modify / run them using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, and iPython Notebook.  Each file link contains detailed documentation on the code and transformations used to create a particular set of models.
